The Insolvency Solver
---
The Insolvency Solver is a tool to help save money. It functions by taking your rent, bills, and other fixed costs, subtracting them from your monthly pay, and applying a daily spending amount.

Think of it as a mini bank and daily wage within your larger, actual wage and bank account. Major purchases require you to save up your daily wage. Meanwhile, your actual wage is being turned into savings (hopefully).
