To Do:

- need to register transactions against existing balance
- need to record transaction log (change to data model req there too)
- need to run daily tasks: update balanace, record transaction day in DB
- all the D3 stuff
- add bootrap for niceness
- add readme
- add description of project on page: this is a mini bank/wage within your larger budget framework:
--> i.e. treat this as your actual day-to-day wage and bank, the savings will then acrue outside of that.


====
Down the line:
- multi-tabbed for different views
- the ability to move from mini bank account/wage to larger picture (savings, actual wage, etc)
